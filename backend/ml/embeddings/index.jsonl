This Court feels it essential to refer to the judgement of the Supreme Court in Joginder Kumar's\ncase where the Supreme Court has extensively discussed the power of the police to affect an arrest.\nThe Supreme Court refers to the third National Police Commission report and extracts therefrom\n\"In India, Third Report of the National Police Commission at p. 32 also suggested: \"An arrest during\nthe investigation of a cognizable case may be considered justified in one or other of the following\ncircumstances: (i) The case involves a grave offence like murder, dacoity, robbery, rape etc., and it is\nnecessary to arrest the accused and bring his movements under restraint to infuse confidence\namong the terror-stricken victims. (ii) The accused is likely to abscond and evade the processes of\nlaw. (iii) The accused is given to violent behaviour and is likely to commit further offences unless his\nmovements are brought under restraint. (iv) The accused is a habitual offender and unless kept in\ncustody he is likely to commit similar offences again. It would be desirable to insist through\ndepartmental instructions that a police officer making an arrest should also record in the case diary\nthe reasons for making the arrest, thereby clarifying his conformity to the specified guidelines ....\"1.\nAfter reproducing the above from the NPC report, the Supreme Court holds \"The above guidelines\nare merely the incidents of personal liberty guaranteed under the Constitution of India. No arrest\ncan be made because it is lawful for the police officer to do so. The existence of the power to arrest is\none thing. The justification for the exercise of it is quite another. The police officer must be able to\njustify the arrest apart from his power to do so. Arrest and detention in police lock-up of a person\ncan cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self- esteem of a person. No arrest can be made in\na routine manner on a mere allegation of commission of an offence made against a person. It would\nbe prudent for a police officer in the interest of protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen and\nperhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made without a reasonable satisfaction reached\nafter some investigation as to the genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a reasonable belief\nboth as to the person's complicity and even so as to the need to effect arrest. Denying a person of his\nliberty is a serious matter. The recommendations of the Police Commission merely reflect the\nconstitutional concomitants of the fundamental right to 1 Joginder Kumar v.

(cid:133) Learned senior\ncounsel pointed out that the order of the Magistrate under Section 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\nthe public generally, and must be specifically against the people or the group which is apprehended\nto disturb the peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons causing the problem, and an\nentire State cannot be brought to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no application\nof mind before passing those orders. (cid:133) While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\nsome material available for the purpose of passing the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the\nquestion which then arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals.

While there can be some restrictions, there can be no blanket\norders, as it would amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be drawn while imposing\nrestrictions on social media/mass communication and the general internet. The least restrictive\noption must be put in place, and the State should have taken preventive or protective measures.\nUltimately, the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their lawful exercise of their\nfundamental rights. (cid:133) On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel submitted that such\nrestrictions not only impact the right to free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\ntrade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as restricting only social media websites like\nFacebook and Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been done in India while\nprohibiting human trafficking and child pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\nto orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017, restricting only social media\nwebsites, and submitted that the same could have been followed in this case as well. (cid:133) Indicating\nthat the State can impose restrictions, the learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n\u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d that can be passed. The learned senior counsel submitted that while\nimposing restrictions, the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the duty of the State to\nensure security. The State must ensure that measures are in place that allows people to continue\nwith their life, such as public transportation for work and schools, to facilitate business, etc. Mr.\nHuzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel for Intervenor in I.A.

Learned\nsenior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the Legality of the\nGeneral Security Service's Interrogation Methods in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v.\nIsrael, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during interrogation of an\nalleged terrorist was permissible.

(cid:133) Learned senior counsel drew parallels between the situation faced by the Israeli\nSupreme Court in the abovementioned case, and that before this Court, wherein, according to the\nlearned senior counsel, the State is attempting to justify the restrictions due to the circumstances\nprevailing in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

While defining as to what constitutes a reasonable restriction,\nthis Court in a plethora of judgments has held that the expression \u201creasonable\nrestriction\u201d seeks to strike a balance between the freedom guaranteed by any of the\nsub\u2212clauses of clause (1) of Article 19 and the social control permitted by any of the\nclauses (2) to (6). It is held that the expression \u201creasonable\u201d connotes that the\nlimitation imposed on a person in the enjoyment of the right should not be arbitrary\nor of an excessive nature beyond what is required in the interests of public. Further,\nin order to be reasonable, the restriction must have a reasonable relation to the object\nwhich the legislation seeks to achieve, and must not go in excess of that object (see\nP.P. Enterprises v. Union of India, (1982) 2 SCC 33). At the same time,\nreasonableness of a restriction has to be determined in an objective manner and from\nthe standpoint of the interests of the general public and not from the point of view of\nthe persons upon whom the restrictions are imposed or upon abstract considerations\n(see Mohd.

We therefore direct that the\nReview Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic\nreview within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule\n2(6). The Review Committee must therefore not only look into the question of whether the\nrestrictions are still in compliance with the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, but\nmust also look into the question of whether the orders are still proportionate, keeping in mind the\nconstitutional consequences of the same.

(cid:133) Learned senior\ncounsel pointed out that the order of the Magistrate under Section 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\nthe public generally, and must be specifically against the people or the group which is apprehended\nto disturb the peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons causing the problem, and an\nentire State cannot be brought to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no application\nof mind before passing those orders. (cid:133) While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\nsome material available for the purpose of passing the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the\nquestion which then arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals.

While there can be some restrictions, there can be no blanket\norders, as it would amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be drawn while imposing\nrestrictions on social media/mass communication and the general internet. The least restrictive\noption must be put in place, and the State should have taken preventive or protective measures.\nUltimately, the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their lawful exercise of their\nfundamental rights. (cid:133) On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel submitted that such\nrestrictions not only impact the right to free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\ntrade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as restricting only social media websites like\nFacebook and Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been done in India while\nprohibiting human trafficking and child pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\nto orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017, restricting only social media\nwebsites, and submitted that the same could have been followed in this case as well. (cid:133) Indicating\nthat the State can impose restrictions, the learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n\u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d that can be passed. The learned senior counsel submitted that while\nimposing restrictions, the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the duty of the State to\nensure security. The State must ensure that measures are in place that allows people to continue\nwith their life, such as public transportation for work and schools, to facilitate business, etc. Mr.\nHuzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel for Intervenor in I.A.

Learned\nsenior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the Legality of the\nGeneral Security Service's Interrogation Methods in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v.\nIsrael, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during interrogation of an\nalleged terrorist was permissible.

(cid:133) Learned senior counsel drew parallels between the situation faced by the Israeli\nSupreme Court in the abovementioned case, and that before this Court, wherein, according to the\nlearned senior counsel, the State is attempting to justify the restrictions due to the circumstances\nprevailing in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

In this context, it is necessary to lay down some\nprocedural safeguard till the aforesaid deficiency is cured by the legislature to ensure that the\nexercise of power under the Suspension Rules is not disproportionate. We therefore direct that the\nReview Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic\nreview within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule\n2(6). The Review Committee must therefore not only look into the question of whether the\nrestrictions are still in compliance with the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, but\nmust also look into the question of whether the orders are still proportionate, keeping in mind the\nconstitutional consequences of the same.

(cid:133) Learned senior\ncounsel pointed out that the order of the Magistrate under Section 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\nthe public generally, and must be specifically against the people or the group which is apprehended\nto disturb the peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons causing the problem, and an\nentire State cannot be brought to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no application\nof mind before passing those orders. (cid:133) While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\nsome material available for the purpose of passing the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the\nquestion which then arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals.

While there can be some restrictions, there can be no blanket\norders, as it would amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be drawn while imposing\nrestrictions on social media/mass communication and the general internet. The least restrictive\noption must be put in place, and the State should have taken preventive or protective measures.\nUltimately, the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their lawful exercise of their\nfundamental rights. (cid:133) On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel submitted that such\nrestrictions not only impact the right to free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\ntrade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as restricting only social media websites like\nFacebook and Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been done in India while\nprohibiting human trafficking and child pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\nto orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017, restricting only social media\nwebsites, and submitted that the same could have been followed in this case as well. (cid:133) Indicating\nthat the State can impose restrictions, the learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n\u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d that can be passed. The learned senior counsel submitted that while\nimposing restrictions, the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the duty of the State to\nensure security. The State must ensure that measures are in place that allows people to continue\nwith their life, such as public transportation for work and schools, to facilitate business, etc. Mr.\nHuzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel for Intervenor in I.A.

Learned\nsenior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the Legality of the\nGeneral Security Service's Interrogation Methods in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v.\nIsrael, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during interrogation of an\nalleged terrorist was permissible.

We therefore direct that the\nReview Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic\nreview within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule\n2(6).

(cid:133) Learned senior\ncounsel pointed out that the order of the Magistrate under Section 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\nthe public generally, and must be specifically against the people or the group which is apprehended\nto disturb the peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons causing the problem, and an\nentire State cannot be brought to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no application\nof mind before passing those orders. (cid:133) While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\nsome material available for the purpose of passing the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the\nquestion which then arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals. (cid:133) The learned senior\ncounsel, with respect to the communications\u2019 restrictions, submitted that the State had not indicated\na s   t o   t h e   n e c e s s i t y   t o   b l o c k   l a n d l i n e   s e r v i c e s .

While there can be some restrictions, there can be no blanket\norders, as it would amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be drawn while imposing\nrestrictions on social media/mass communication and the general internet. The least restrictive\noption must be put in place, and the State should have taken preventive or protective measures.\nUltimately, the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their lawful exercise of their\nfundamental rights. (cid:133) On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel submitted that such\nrestrictions not only impact the right to free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\ntrade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as restricting only social media websites like\nFacebook and Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been done in India while\nprohibiting human trafficking and child pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\nto orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017, restricting only social media\nwebsites, and submitted that the same could have been followed in this case as well. (cid:133) Indicating\nthat the State can impose restrictions, the learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n\u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d that can be passed. The learned senior counsel submitted that while\nimposing restrictions, the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the duty of the State to\nensure security. The State must ensure that measures are in place that allows people to continue\nwith their life, such as public transportation for work and schools, to facilitate business, etc. Mr.\nHuzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel for Intervenor in I.A.

(C) No. 1031 of\n2019 (cid:133) Learned senior counsel attempted to highlight that the issue of balancing the measures\nnecessary for ensuring national security or curbing terrorism, with the rights of the citizens, is an\nendeavour that is not unique, and has been undertaken by Courts in various jurisdictions. Learned\nsenior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the Legality of the\nGeneral Security Service's Interrogation Methods in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v.\nIsrael, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during interrogation of an\nalleged terrorist was permissible. In that case, the Israeli Supreme Court held that such acts were\nunconstitutional, and could not be justified in light of the freedoms and liberties afforded to the\ncitizens of Israel. (cid:133) Learned senior counsel drew parallels between the situation faced by the Israeli\nSupreme Court in the abovementioned case, and that before this Court, wherein, according to the\nlearned senior counsel, the State is attempting to justify the restrictions due to the circumstances\nprevailing in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

The development of the jurisprudence in protecting the medium for expression can be traced to\nthe case of Indian Express v. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641, wherein this Court had declared that\nthe freedom of print medium is covered under the freedom of speech and expression. In Odyssey\nCommunications Pvt. Ltd. v. Lokvidayan Sanghatana, (1988) 3 SCC 410, it was held that the right of\ncitizens to exhibit films on Doordarshan, subject to the terms and conditions to be imposed by the\nDoordarshan, is a part of the fundamental right of freedom of expression guaranteed under Article\n19(1)(a), which can be curtailed only under circumstances set out under Article 19(2). Further, this\nCourt expanded this protection to the use of airwaves in the case of Secretary, Ministry of\nInformation & Broadcasting, Government of India (supra). In this context, we may note that this\nCourt, in a catena of judgments, has recognized free speech as a fundamental right, and, as\ntechnology has evolved, has recognized the freedom of speech and expression over different media\nof expression. Expression through the internet has gained contemporary relevance and is one of the\nmajor means of information diffusion. Therefore, the freedom of speech and expression through the\nmedium of internet is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a) and accordingly, any restriction on the\nsame must be in accordance with Article 19(2) of the Constitution."}

In this context, it is necessary to lay down some\nprocedural safeguard till the aforesaid deficiency is cured by the legislature to ensure that the\nexercise of power under the Suspension Rules is not disproportionate. We therefore direct that the\nReview Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic\nreview within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule\n2(6). The Review Committee must therefore not only look into the question of whether the\nrestrictions are still in compliance with the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, but\nmust also look into the question of whether the orders are still proportionate, keeping in mind the\nconstitutional consequences of the same.

Union of India, 1970 (1) SCC 248, wherein the test of \u2018direct\nand inevitable consequence\u2019 was propounded. As this is not a case wherein a detailed analysis of\nchilling effect is required for the reasons given below, we leave the question of law open as to the\nappropriate standard for establishing causal link in a challenge based on chilling effect."}

(cid:133) Learned senior\ncounsel pointed out that the order of the Magistrate under Section 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\nthe public generally, and must be specifically against the people or the group which is apprehended\nto disturb the peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons causing the problem, and an\nentire State cannot be brought to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no application\nof mind before passing those orders. (cid:133) While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\nsome material available for the purpose of passing the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the\nquestion which then arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals.

While there can be some restrictions, there can be no blanket\norders, as it would amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be drawn while imposing\nrestrictions on social media/mass communication and the general internet. The least restrictive\noption must be put in place, and the State should have taken preventive or protective measures.\nUltimately, the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their lawful exercise of their\nfundamental rights. (cid:133) On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel submitted that such\nrestrictions not only impact the right to free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\ntrade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as restricting only social media websites like\nFacebook and Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been done in India while\nprohibiting human trafficking and child pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\nto orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017, restricting only social media\nwebsites, and submitted that the same could have been followed in this case as well. (cid:133) Indicating\nthat the State can impose restrictions, the learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n\u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d that can be passed. The learned senior counsel submitted that while\nimposing restrictions, the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the duty of the State to\nensure security.

Learned\nsenior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the Legality of the\nGeneral Security Service's Interrogation Methods in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v.\nIsrael, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during interrogation of an\nalleged terrorist was permissible.

(cid:133) Learned senior counsel drew parallels between the situation faced by the Israeli\nSupreme Court in the abovementioned case, and that before this Court, wherein, according to the\nlearned senior counsel, the State is attempting to justify the restrictions due to the circumstances\nprevailing in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

We therefore direct that the\nReview Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic\nreview within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule\n2(6). The Review Committee must therefore not only look into the question of whether the\nrestrictions are still in compliance with the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, but\nmust also look into the question of whether the orders are still proportionate, keeping in mind the\nconstitutional consequences of the same.

(cid:133) Learned senior\ncounsel pointed out that the order of the Magistrate under Section 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\nthe public generally, and must be specifically against the people or the group which is apprehended\nto disturb the peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons causing the problem, and an\nentire State cannot be brought to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no application\nof mind before passing those orders. (cid:133) While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\nsome material available for the purpose of passing the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the\nquestion which then arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals.

While there can be some restrictions, there can be no blanket\norders, as it would amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be drawn while imposing\nrestrictions on social media/mass communication and the general internet. The least restrictive\noption must be put in place, and the State should have taken preventive or protective measures.\nUltimately, the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their lawful exercise of their\nfundamental rights. (cid:133) On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel submitted that such\nrestrictions not only impact the right to free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\ntrade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as restricting only social media websites like\nFacebook and Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been done in India while\nprohibiting human trafficking and child pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\nto orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017, restricting only social media\nwebsites, and submitted that the same could have been followed in this case as well. (cid:133) Indicating\nthat the State can impose restrictions, the learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n\u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d that can be passed. The learned senior counsel submitted that while\nimposing restrictions, the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the duty of the State to\nensure security. The State must ensure that measures are in place that allows people to continue\nwith their life, such as public transportation for work and schools, to facilitate business, etc. Mr.\nHuzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel for Intervenor in I.A.

Learned\nsenior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the Legality of the\nGeneral Security Service's Interrogation Methods in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v.\nIsrael, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during interrogation of an\nalleged terrorist was permissible.

(cid:133) Learned senior counsel drew parallels between the situation faced by the Israeli\nSupreme Court in the abovementioned case, and that before this Court, wherein, according to the\nlearned senior counsel, the State is attempting to justify the restrictions due to the circumstances\nprevailing in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Review Committee must therefore not only look into the question of whether the\nrestrictions are still in compliance with the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, but\nmust also look into the question of whether the orders are still proportionate, keeping in mind the\nconstitutional consequences of the same. We clarify that looking to the fact that the restrictions\ncontemplated under the Suspension Rules are temporary in nature, the same must not be allowed to\nextend beyond that time period which is necessary."}

Further, learned senior counsel Mr. Kapil Sibal expressed his concern that in the future any\nState could pass such type of blanket restrictions, for example, to prevent opposition parties from\ncontesting or participating in elections. In this context, it is sufficient to note that the power under\nSection 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be used as a tool to prevent the legitimate expression of opinion or\ngrievance or exercise of any democratic rights. Our Constitution protects the expression of divergent\nviews, legitimate expressions and disapproval, and this cannot be the basis for invocation of Section\n144, Cr.P.C. unless there is sufficient material to show that there is likely to be an incitement to\nviolence or threat to public safety or danger.

It is enough to note that sufficient safeguards exist in Section 144, Cr.P.C., including the\npresence of judicial review challenging any abuse of power under the Section, to allay the\napprehensions of the petitioner."}

(cid:133) Learned senior\ncounsel pointed out that the order of the Magistrate under Section 144, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\nthe public generally, and must be specifically against the people or the group which is apprehended\nto disturb the peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons causing the problem, and an\nentire State cannot be brought to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no application\nof mind before passing those orders. (cid:133) While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\nsome material available for the purpose of passing the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the\nquestion which then arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals.

While there can be some restrictions, there can be no blanket\norders, as it would amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be drawn while imposing\nrestrictions on social media/mass communication and the general internet. The least restrictive\noption must be put in place, and the State should have taken preventive or protective measures.\nUltimately, the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their lawful exercise of their\nfundamental rights. (cid:133) On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel submitted that such\nrestrictions not only impact the right to free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\ntrade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as restricting only social media websites like\nFacebook and Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been done in India while\nprohibiting human trafficking and child pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\nto orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017, restricting only social media\nwebsites, and submitted that the same could have been followed in this case as well. (cid:133) Indicating\nthat the State can impose restrictions, the learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n\u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d that can be passed. The learned senior counsel submitted that while\nimposing restrictions, the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the duty of the State to\nensure security. The State must ensure that measures are in place that allows people to continue\nwith their life, such as public transportation for work and schools, to facilitate business, etc. Mr.\nHuzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel for Intervenor in I.A.

Learned\nsenior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the Legality of the\nGeneral Security Service's Interrogation Methods in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v.\nIsrael, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during interrogation of an\nalleged terrorist was permissible.

We therefore direct that the\nReview Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic\nreview within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule\n2(6).

The power under Section 144, Cr.P.C cannot be used to suppress legitimate\nexpression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights. l. An order\npassed under Section 144, Cr.P.C. should state the material facts to enable judicial\nreview of the same. The power should be exercised in a bona fide and reasonable\nmanner, and the same should be passed by relying on the material facts, indicative of\napplication of mind. This will enable judicial scrutiny of the aforesaid order. m.While\nexercising the power under Section 144, Cr.P.C., the Magistrate is duty bound to\nbalance the rights and restrictions based on the principles of proportionality and\nthereafter, apply the least intrusive measure. n. Repetitive orders under Section 144,\nCr.P.C. would be an abuse of power."}
